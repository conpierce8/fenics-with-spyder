    "# About this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents a procedure to install FEniCS using Anaconda. The [first step](#Step-1:-install-Anaconda) in the notebook (installing Anaconda itself) needs to be completed from a terminal window. You can then continue to install manually by following [Method 1](#Method-1:-manual-installation-from-terminal), or, once you have a working Anaconda installation, you can launch this notebook using Jupyter and install automatically by running the commands in [Method 2](#Method-2:-automatic-installation-from-this-notebook) (not yet implemented). An optional [final step](#Step-4-(optional):-Spyder-desktop-shortcut) is to create shortcuts for the desktop and the application launcher for convenient booting of Spyder.\n",

    "# Step 0: removing a pre-existing FEniCS installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have arrived here after discovering that your installation of FEniCS is dysfunctional, you may want to remove your previous FEniCS installation to prevent any conflicts with the Anaconda installation you are about to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `apt` installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed FEniCS using `apt`, the `purge` option with auto remove should clear FEniCS and all its configuration and dependent packages so that you can create a fresh installation using the instructions in this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fresh terminal window (Ctrl+Shift+t), type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove fenics\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you used a PPA to install the software, you may need to also run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo ppa-purge ppa:fenics-packages/fenics\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anaconda installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If the previous installation is in Anaconda you can remove by FEniCS installation by removing the entire conda environment containaing FEniCS. With the terminal (base) environment active, you can remove the FEniCS environment using:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env remove -n fenicsproject\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda remove -n fenicsproject --all\n",
    "```\n",
    "will have the same effect. If you installed FEniCS to a different conda environment than `fenicsproject`, replace `fenicsproject` with the environment name.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since Spyder is within Anaconda, you may be able to skip to step 2b and associate Spyder without removing FEniCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you plan to plot FEniCS objects directly from Python, you'll need the `matplotlib` module. In this case, removing the existing environment and creating a fresh enivronment may be the best idea before moving to step 2a."

    "\n",
    "In this section, we set up a new conda environment in which FEniCS will be installed. First, we will set up a conda environment called \"fenicsproject\". I recommend using the Python version from the official Anaconda channels (currently 3.8 as of 2021-05-19), since I've had issues when using the Python 3.9 interpreter from the \"conda-forge\" channel. I also like to install packages from the official Anaconda channel when possible. Therefore, rather than use the `-c conda-forge` option from the [standard installation instructions](https://fenicsproject.org/download/) (which seems to prompt all packages to be installed from conda-forge) when creating my environment, I first create the environment without installing FEniCS, configure my conda environment with \"conda-forge\" as my second-priority channel, and then install FEniCS in the last step. Stepwise, this looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create the conda environment named \"fenicsproject\" and install Python 3.8. From the terminal, run \n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   conda create -n fenicsproject --yes python=3.8.*\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   * If you wish to install `matplotlib`, it is best to install it at this point to avoid dependency conflicts that may arise after you install `fenics`. To install `matplotlib`, use instead:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      conda create -n fenicsproject --yes python=3.8 matplotlib\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "2. Activate the fenicsproject environment:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   conda activate fenicsproject\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Set \"conda-forge\" as an alternate package source:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   conda config --append channels conda-forge\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2.2: Install FEniCS and optional packages\n",

    "```\n",
    "conda install --yes fenics\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Optional__: FEniCS contains a select few simple built-in meshes. For more complicated problems, you will need to install another meshing package. A comparison of several free meshing packages can be found here: [https://github.com/nschloe/meshgen-comparison](https://github.com/nschloe/meshgen-comparison). You may also wish to install the `mshr` and `meshio` packages. `mshr` is no longer maintained, but is tightly integrated with FEniCS and provides a useful extension of the FEniCS built-in meshes. In addition, `mshr` may be helpful for new FEniCS users because it is used in many of the FEniCS tutorials. The mesh format converter, `meshio`, is a very helpful tool that enables FEniCS to work with meshes generated by a variety of meshing packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install `meshio` and `mshr`, run the following commands:\n",

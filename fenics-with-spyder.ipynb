    "# About this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents a procedure to install FEniCS using Anaconda. The [first step](#Step-1:-install-Anaconda) in the notebook (installing Anaconda itself) needs to be completed from a terminal window. You can then continue to install manually by following [Method 1](#Method-1:-manual-installation-from-terminal), or, once you have a working Anaconda installation, you can launch this notebook using Jupyter and install automatically by running the commands in [Method 2](#Method-2:-automatic-installation-from-this-notebook) (not yet implemented). An optional [final step](#Step-4-(optional):-Spyder-desktop-shortcut) is to create shortcuts for the desktop and the application launcher for convenient booting of Spyder.\n",

    "This step must be completed manually from the terminal, regardless of whether you plan to use the manual [Method 1](#Method-1:-manual-installation-from-terminal) or the automatic [Method 2](#Method-2:-automatic-installation-from-this-notebook). (This is obvious, since you cannot execute this notebook without an Anaconda installation!) To install Anaconda:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the Anaconda installer from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads. As of the time of this writing (2021-05-19), the current version is Python 3.8.\n",

    "7. When prompted \"Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init? [yes|no]\", choose yes. This will set up your terminal by prepending the Anaconda installation to your `PATH`, making the Anaconda Python interpreter the first Python interpreter found by the shell.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we set up a new conda environment in which FEniCS will be installed. First, we will set up a conda environment called \"fenicsproject\". I recommend using the Python version from the official Anaconda channels (currently 3.8 as of 2021-05-19), since I've had issues when using the Python 3.9 interpreter from the \"conda-forge\" channel. I also like to install packages from the official Anaconda channel when possible. Therefore, rather than use the `-c conda-forge` option from the [standard installation instructions](https://fenicsproject.org/download/) (which seems to prompt all packages to be installed from conda-forge) when creating my environment, I first create the environment without installing FEniCS, configure my conda environment with \"conda-forge\" as my second-priority channel, and then install FEniCS in the last step. Stepwise, this looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create the conda environement named \"fenicsproject\" and install Python 3.8. From the terminal, run \n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",

    "3. Set \"conda-forge\" as an alternate package source:\n",

    "   conda config --append channels conda-forge\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. Install FEniCS:\n",

To run FEniCS codes, we must tell Spyder to open the console using the Python interpreter found in the \"fenicsproject\" environment. In order for this to succeed, we must have the \"spyder-kernels\" package installed in the \"fenicsproject\" environment. It's important to install the correct version of \"spyder-kernels\" that is compatible with our Spyder installation (Spyder seems to be picky about this, we'll get an error if we have the wrong version). Above, when I ran the command:\n",

    "To enable plotting in a separate window, go to __Tools > Preferences > IPython console > Graphics > Graphics backend__ and choose \"Qt5\" for the backend. When you click \"OK\", Spyder will probably prompt you to restart the kernel. I have found that this often produces a warning, an error, or the console simply \"hangs\". Opening a new console seems to fix this and cause the changes to take effect."
